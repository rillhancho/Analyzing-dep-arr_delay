# Analyzing-dep-arr_delay
This project first performs data cleaning before gaining insights in the given dataset. The dataset consisted of rows that were not helpful to the insights that we were trying to derive so we used the drop() function to delete them and we permanently commited the changes after backing up the original dataset.
After that we deleted the negative values as they only indicated that either the plane arrived early or departed early and that was not helpful on the insights we were trying to gain.

Here is our plots and findings:
